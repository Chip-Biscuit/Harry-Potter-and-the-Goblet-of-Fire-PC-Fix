# General point
– the issue that caused the game to hard crash with resolutions above 1080p on certain levels has been patched with this fix.

# Instructions
Go to releases, download the Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Fix, extract the d3d9.dll and d3d9.ini files into your game folder next to the gof_f.exe file and you are good to go! You can edit the settings you wish to use in the d3d9.ini file.

# Resolution/Aspect Ratio
The default for resolution is set to (1920 x 1080) in the d3d9.ini file. Put the resolution that you wish to use in both the Width and Height area.

The default for aspect ratio is (1) which is (16:9). Choose the aspect ratio that is correct for you from the selection within the d3d9.ini file and replace (1) with the number correct for you.

# FPS
The default for FPS is (60) you can change it as you wish or fully uncap it with 0 with the FPSLimit option in the d3d9.ini file.

# FOV
The default for FOV is (0) which is the original games FOV 114. You can replace (0) with a number that is higher than 114 to zoom out FOV in the game.
